Minimum Requirements
Having a GPU is not necessary, but will speed training time.
Prediction time is arounf 14 sec 

Software Requirements
To run this code, you need to have the following libraries installed:

python3
tensorflow >= 2.0
matplotlib
nibabel
pydicom
numpy
scikit-image
h5py < 3.0.0


Usage

python3 MoCIDet.py -data_path path/to/folder/containing/volumes -data_type 'image_type' -save_file 'name_to_save_predictions'

arguments: 
    data_path is the path to the directory where the acquisitions are
    data_type is the acquisition type:
                nifti
                dicom - volumetric one dicom file
                multi-dicom - volumetric multiple dicom files
                dicom-2D - multiple 2D dicom files 
    save_file is the txt file to save the motion-presence probabilities.

To display the partial results of the predictions use -display
To save a sample of slice presenting the minimum and the maximum probability use -save_slice
